# Time Series Forecasting for Furniture Sales
## Overview:
This notebook focuses on time series analysis and forecasting for furniture sales using the provided 4-year furniture sales dataset. The notebook covers data preprocessing, time series indexing, visualization, forecasting with ARIMA, and model comparisons, as well as exploring furniture sales in comparison with office supplies sales.

## Key Steps:
1. Data Preprocessing
2. Time Series Indexing
3. Visualization
4. Forecasting with ARIMA
5. Comparative Analysis of ARIMA Models
6. Comparison with Office Supplies Sales
7. Time Series Modeling with Prophet
## Data Preprocessing:
Loaded the furniture sales dataset and preprocessed it by removing unnecessary columns, checking for missing values, and aggregating sales by date.
## Time Series Indexing:
Converted datetime data to daily sales averages by month.
## Visualization:
Created time series plots to identify trends, seasonality, and outliers.
Created a seasonal decomposition of time series (STL) plot to identify seasonal components.
Plotted furniture sales data, highlighting seasonal patterns and decomposition.
## Forecasting with ARIMA:
Applied ARIMA models for sales forecasting and evaluated different parameter combinations.
## Comparative Analysis:
Compared furniture and office supplies sales patterns, revealing insights into sales trends in the two categories.
## Time Series Modeling with Prophet:
Explored the Prophet time series modeling library for forecasting furniture sales.

## How to Use:
Download or clone the notebook file "(Time_Series_Forecastings.ipynb)" and the dataset "Global Superstore 2018.xlsx".
Open the notebook in Jupyter or any preferred environment to run the code.
Follow the step-by-step analysis and instructions provided in the notebook.
## Additional Information:
Python libraries used: Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Statsmodels, Prophet.
